# DREAD Reckoning

## What Is DREAD?

DREAD stands for "Difficulty Regulting Emotion and Attention Divergence". It was an attempt (by 
[@3TrackMind79](https://twitter.com/3TrackMind79) and [@ADHDelaide](https://twitter.com/ADHDelaide) on Twitter) to rename ADHD 
(Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) to something more accurate, appropriate, and less misleading.

### Why Change The Name?

The name ADHD draws the focus on its two most easily identifyable components: "attention deficit" and "hyperactivity". The use of these
terms in a scientific context is exceedingly dangerous due to the subjective nature, which has led to toxic dangers like teachers with
no business offering diagnoses doing exactly that, news commentators perpetuating propaganda against us, and our own struggles for 
legitimacy.

"DREAD" is an attempt to relabel it closer to how those of us with the disorder feel it and live with it. Not being able to control our
focus, our emotions, our imaginations, even our senses is central to our lives - every minute of every hour of every day, constantly 
craving or attempting to process an endless stream of data from both without and within. The perceived "hyperactivity" of jiggling a knee
or clicking a pen is often a coping mechanism as opposed to a symptom.

But ADHD/DREAD is much bigger and more complex than that. It is a disability of the 
[Executive Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions), a set of particular complex processes within the brain that 
govern mental regulation and organization, including attention control, emotional control, inhibitions, working memory, planning, 
task management, and context switching, just to name a few.

## What Is DREAD Reckoning?

DREAD Reckoning is an attempt to create an organizational assistant app tailored to these disabilities to help with day-to-day 
task-management, planning, and routine maintenance, with the hope that it might also help people who don't have these disabilities as well.
